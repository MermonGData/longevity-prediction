# Longevity Analysis: Cross-Country Indicators (2000–2015)

## Data
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It contains annual country-level indicators related to health, economics, demographics, and public policy for 193 countries between 2000 and 2015 compiled from WHO and World Bank sources.

The target variable is **Life Expectancy at Birth**.

A full description of all 22 variables is available in [`docs/data_dictionary.md`](docs/data_dictionary.md).

## Project Status / To-Do
- README, I guess
- Standardize variable names (currently inconsistent capitalization etc etc)
- Clean and preprocess data for modeling
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Visualizations and interpretation
- so pretty much everything at this point
